## Setup
The API-server is configured via environment variables, and/or an `.env` file.

For local development, copy the `.env.dist` file to `.env` and update it with
the proper credentials.

## Running the app
First off, you should be using the tasks defined in the root [README.md](../).

The following is if you want to run the development commands manually.

```bash
# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# unit tests
$ yarn run test
```
